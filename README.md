# Drupal 7 Tutorial - Schools
## Overview
In this tutorial, we will work on a sample project that displays a list of schools and allows up to
add, update, and delete schools.

We first go through the installation of Drupal. After that, we will learn
about how to register pages in Drupal so that they can be accessed by their respective URLs. The
concepts of form and form state are covered next, to be able to handle form submit that
connect front-end with back-end. We will also learn the View API, Entity API in Drupal after going
through Form API. Finally, we will shed lights on theming and page layout overrides. Throughout the
tutorial there the concept of hooks will be mentioned from time to time.
